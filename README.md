Language - Java.<br>

Framework - Java Spring Boot.<br>

MySQL database is running in Azure Cloud Service.<br>

For validation i am using Spring Boot Started Validation<br>
	
Since i have been working with a Postman, i generated API documentation there<br>

I didn't hide credentials of database in application.properties file since this is a mock db.<br>
